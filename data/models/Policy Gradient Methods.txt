This file outlines Policy Gradient Methods, explaining their approach in reinforcement learning.

Policy Gradient Methods are a class of algorithms in reinforcement learning that optimize the policy directly. Unlike value-based methods, which estimate the value of states or actions, policy gradient methods focus on finding the best policy that maximizes the expected return.

Key concepts include:

1. **Policy Representation**: The policy can be represented as a neural network that outputs a probability distribution over actions given a state.

2. **Objective Function**: The objective is to maximize the expected return, which can be expressed as:
   J(θ) = E[∑(t=0 to T) γ^t * r_t]
   where θ are the parameters of the policy, γ is the discount factor, and r_t is the reward at time t.

3. **Gradient Estimation**: The policy gradient can be estimated using the REINFORCE algorithm, which uses the following update rule:
   θ ← θ + α * ∇_θ J(θ)
   where α is the learning rate.

4. **Advantages**: Policy gradient methods can handle high-dimensional action spaces and are suitable for stochastic policies.

5. **Common Algorithms**: Some popular policy gradient algorithms include:
   - REINFORCE
   - Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
   - Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)

Policy gradient methods are widely used in various applications, including robotics, game playing, and natural language processing, due to their flexibility and effectiveness in complex environments.
