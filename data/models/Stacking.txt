This file discusses Stacking, explaining its method of combining multiple models. Stacking is an ensemble learning technique that involves training a new model to combine the predictions of several base models. The base models are typically trained on the same dataset, and their predictions are used as input features for the final model, often referred to as the meta-model. This approach can improve predictive performance by leveraging the strengths of different algorithms and reducing the risk of overfitting. Stacking is commonly used in machine learning competitions and real-world applications where model diversity can lead to better results.
