This file describes Genetic Programming, explaining its method of evolving programs. Genetic Programming is a type of evolutionary algorithm that automatically solves problems by evolving computer programs. It uses techniques inspired by biological evolution, such as selection, crossover, and mutation, to create programs that can perform specific tasks. Genetic Programming is particularly useful for optimization problems and can generate solutions that are not easily formulated by human programmers. Its applications range from symbolic regression to automated design and machine learning.
