Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a group of algorithms in multivariate statistics and linear algebra where a given non-negative matrix \( V \) is factorized into two non-negative matrices \( W \) and \( H \). This factorization allows for the representation of the original data in a lower-dimensional space, making it useful for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and data compression.

NMF is particularly effective in applications where interpretability of the components is important, such as in image processing, text mining, and collaborative filtering. The non-negativity constraint ensures that the components can be interpreted as parts of the whole, which is often desirable in real-world data scenarios.

Applications of NMF include:

1. **Image Processing**: Decomposing images into parts for tasks like object recognition.
2. **Text Mining**: Identifying topics in documents by factorizing term-document matrices.
3. **Recommender Systems**: Extracting latent features from user-item interaction matrices to improve recommendations.

Overall, NMF provides a powerful tool for analyzing and understanding complex datasets while maintaining interpretability.
