This file discusses Transformer Networks, detailing their architecture and applications in NLP. Transformer networks are a type of deep learning model that utilize self-attention mechanisms to process input data in parallel, making them highly efficient for tasks such as natural language processing (NLP). They have revolutionized the field by enabling the development of state-of-the-art models like BERT and GPT, which excel in understanding context and generating human-like text. Their architecture consists of an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder processes the input sequence and the decoder generates the output sequence, allowing for effective handling of various tasks such as translation, summarization, and question answering.
