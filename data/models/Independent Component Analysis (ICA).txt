This file outlines Independent Component Analysis (ICA), explaining its use in separating mixed signals.

Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a computational technique used to separate a multivariate signal into additive, independent components. It is widely used in the fields of signal processing and data analysis, particularly for applications such as:

1. **Blind Source Separation**: ICA is commonly applied in scenarios where the source signals are unknown and mixed together, such as separating different audio sources from a single recording.

2. **Neuroimaging**: In functional MRI (fMRI) data analysis, ICA helps identify brain networks by separating the underlying independent signals from the observed data.

3. **Feature Extraction**: ICA can be used to extract relevant features from high-dimensional data, improving the performance of machine learning models.

The key assumption of ICA is that the source signals are statistically independent and non-Gaussian. The method typically involves the following steps:

- Centering the data: Subtracting the mean to ensure the data has a zero mean.
- Whiten the data: Transforming the data to have unit variance and be uncorrelated.
- Estimating the independent components: Using algorithms such as FastICA to find the independent sources.

ICA is particularly effective in scenarios where traditional methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) may fail, especially when the signals are mixed in a non-linear manner.
