Random Forest Classification is an ensemble learning method primarily used for classification tasks. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) of the individual trees. 

Key features of Random Forest Classification include:

1. **Ensemble Learning**: Combines the predictions of several base estimators (decision trees) to improve robustness and accuracy.
2. **Reduction of Overfitting**: By averaging the results of multiple trees, it reduces the risk of overfitting compared to a single decision tree.
3. **Feature Importance**: Provides insights into the importance of different features in making predictions.
4. **Handling Missing Values**: Capable of maintaining accuracy even when a large proportion of the data is missing.
5. **Versatility**: Can be used for both classification and regression tasks.

Applications of Random Forest Classification include:
- Medical diagnosis
- Credit scoring
- Image classification
- Customer segmentation

Overall, Random Forest Classification is a powerful tool in the machine learning toolkit, known for its accuracy and ease of use.
