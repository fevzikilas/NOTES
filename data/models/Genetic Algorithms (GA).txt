This file outlines Genetic Algorithms, detailing their evolutionary approach to optimization.

Genetic Algorithms (GA) are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection. They are used to find approximate solutions to complex problems by mimicking the process of evolution. The key components of Genetic Algorithms include:

1. **Population**: A set of potential solutions to the optimization problem, represented as individuals.

2. **Fitness Function**: A function that evaluates how well each individual solves the problem. The fitness score determines the likelihood of an individual being selected for reproduction.

3. **Selection**: The process of choosing individuals from the population based on their fitness scores. Common selection methods include roulette wheel selection and tournament selection.

4. **Crossover**: A genetic operator that combines two parent individuals to produce offspring. This process introduces new genetic material into the population.

5. **Mutation**: A genetic operator that introduces random changes to an individual's genes. Mutation helps maintain genetic diversity within the population.

6. **Termination**: The algorithm continues to evolve the population through selection, crossover, and mutation until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of generations or a satisfactory fitness level.

Genetic Algorithms are widely used in various fields, including engineering design, machine learning, and optimization problems, due to their ability to explore large search spaces and find near-optimal solutions.
