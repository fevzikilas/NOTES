This file discusses Neuro-Fuzzy Systems, explaining their integration of neural networks and fuzzy logic. Neuro-Fuzzy Systems combine the learning capabilities of neural networks with the reasoning capabilities of fuzzy logic, allowing for more flexible and interpretable models. They are particularly useful in situations where data is uncertain or imprecise, making them applicable in various fields such as control systems, decision-making, and pattern recognition. The architecture typically involves a fuzzy inference system that is tuned using neural network learning algorithms, enabling the model to adapt and improve over time.
