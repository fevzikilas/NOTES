Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term to prevent overfitting. It adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with multicollinearity, where independent variables are highly correlated.

Mathematically, Ridge Regression minimizes the following cost function:

L(β) = ||y - Xβ||² + λ||β||²

Where:
- L(β) is the loss function.
- y is the vector of observed values.
- X is the matrix of input features.
- β is the vector of coefficients.
- λ (lambda) is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of the penalty.

Use Cases:
- Ridge Regression is commonly used in scenarios where the number of predictors exceeds the number of observations.
- It is effective in situations where multicollinearity is present, as it stabilizes the estimates of the coefficients.
- It can be applied in various fields such as finance, biology, and social sciences for predictive modeling.
