Co-training is a semi-supervised learning technique that leverages multiple views of the same data to improve the learning process. It involves training two or more classifiers on different feature sets or representations of the data. Each classifier is trained on a labeled dataset and then used to label the unlabeled data. The key idea is that each classifier can provide additional training examples for the other, thus enhancing the overall model performance.

In co-training, the classifiers are typically chosen to be diverse, meaning they should make different errors on the data. This diversity allows the classifiers to complement each other, leading to better generalization. Co-training is particularly useful in scenarios where labeled data is scarce, but there is an abundance of unlabeled data.

Applications of co-training include natural language processing tasks, such as text classification and information extraction, where different feature sets (e.g., word-based and character-based features) can be utilized.
