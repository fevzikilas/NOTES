This file describes Neural Evolution, detailing its hybrid approach that combines neural networks and genetic algorithms. Neural Evolution leverages the strengths of both methodologies to optimize neural network architectures and parameters through evolutionary strategies. This approach allows for the exploration of a diverse set of solutions, enabling the discovery of effective models that may not be easily found through traditional training methods. Applications of Neural Evolution include automated machine learning, optimization of deep learning models, and adaptive systems that evolve over time to improve performance in dynamic environments.
