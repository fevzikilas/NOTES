Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed to generate new data instances that resemble a given training dataset. They consist of two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, which are trained simultaneously through adversarial processes.

The generator creates fake data, while the discriminator evaluates its authenticity, distinguishing between real and generated data. This competition drives both networks to improve, resulting in the generator producing increasingly realistic data.

GANs have a wide range of applications, including image generation, video generation, and voice synthesis. They are particularly effective in tasks where labeled data is scarce, as they can learn to generate new instances based on the underlying distribution of the training data.
