K-Means Clustering

Definition:
K-Means is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data into distinct groups based on feature similarity. The algorithm partitions the dataset into K clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize K centroids randomly from the dataset.
2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming K clusters.
3. Recalculate the centroids as the mean of all data points in each cluster.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids no longer change significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

Applications:
- Market segmentation
- Image compression
- Anomaly detection
- Document clustering

Advantages:
- Simple and easy to implement.
- Efficient for large datasets.
- Works well when clusters are spherical and evenly sized.

Limitations:
- Requires the number of clusters (K) to be specified in advance.
- Sensitive to the initial placement of centroids.
- May converge to a local minimum, leading to suboptimal clustering.
