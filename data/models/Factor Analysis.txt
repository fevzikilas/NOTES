This file discusses Factor Analysis, explaining its use in identifying underlying relationships among variables. Factor Analysis is a statistical method used to describe variability among observed, correlated variables in terms of fewer unobserved variables called factors. It helps in data reduction and structure detection, making it useful in various fields such as psychology, finance, and social sciences. By analyzing the correlations between variables, Factor Analysis can reveal latent constructs that influence the observed data, aiding in the interpretation and understanding of complex datasets.
