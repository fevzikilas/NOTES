This file discusses Bagging, detailing its ensemble learning technique. Bagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, is a method that improves the stability and accuracy of machine learning algorithms. It works by creating multiple subsets of the original dataset through random sampling with replacement. Each subset is used to train a separate model, and the final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions from all models, typically through averaging for regression tasks or majority voting for classification tasks. Bagging helps to reduce variance and combat overfitting, making it particularly effective for high-variance models like decision trees.
