This file discusses Gaussian Processes, detailing their applications in regression and classification. Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a powerful non-parametric Bayesian approach used for regression and classification tasks. They provide a flexible way to model complex data distributions and quantify uncertainty in predictions.

### Key Concepts:
- **Definition**: A Gaussian Process is a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution.
- **Kernel Function**: The choice of kernel function is crucial as it defines the covariance structure of the process. Common kernels include the Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Mat√©rn kernels.
- **Hyperparameters**: GPs have hyperparameters that control the behavior of the kernel function, which can be optimized using techniques like maximum likelihood estimation.
- **Applications**: GPs are widely used in various fields, including:
  - **Regression**: For predicting continuous outcomes with uncertainty estimates.
  - **Classification**: For binary and multi-class classification tasks, often using a logistic link function.
  - **Bayesian Optimization**: For optimizing expensive-to-evaluate functions.

### Advantages:
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: GPs provide a natural way to quantify uncertainty in predictions.
- **Flexibility**: They can model complex relationships without assuming a specific functional form.

### Limitations:
- **Computational Complexity**: GPs can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets, as they require inversion of the covariance matrix.
- **Scalability**: Techniques like sparse GPs or inducing points are often used to address scalability issues.

In summary, Gaussian Processes are a versatile tool in the machine learning toolkit, particularly useful for tasks where uncertainty quantification is essential.
