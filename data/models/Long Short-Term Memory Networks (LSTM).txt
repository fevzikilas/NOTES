This file describes Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), detailing their architecture and advantages in handling long sequences.

LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to model sequential data. They are particularly effective in capturing long-range dependencies in data, which is a common challenge in traditional RNNs due to issues like vanishing gradients.

The architecture of an LSTM includes memory cells, input gates, output gates, and forget gates. This structure allows LSTMs to maintain information over long periods, making them suitable for tasks such as language modeling, speech recognition, and time series forecasting.

Advantages of LSTMs include their ability to learn from long sequences, robustness to noise, and effectiveness in various applications, including natural language processing and video analysis.
