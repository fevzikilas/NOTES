Random Forest is an ensemble learning method primarily used for classification and regression tasks. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes (for classification) or mean prediction (for regression) of the individual trees.

Key Features:
- **Ensemble Method**: Combines the predictions of several decision trees to improve accuracy and control overfitting.
- **Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging)**: Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data, which helps to reduce variance.
- **Feature Randomness**: At each split in the tree, a random subset of features is considered, which enhances diversity among the trees.

Advantages:
- **Robustness**: Performs well on a wide range of datasets and is less sensitive to noise.
- **Interpretability**: While individual trees are interpretable, the overall model can still provide insights through feature importance scores.
- **Scalability**: Can handle large datasets efficiently.

Applications:
- Used in various domains such as finance for credit scoring, healthcare for disease prediction, and marketing for customer segmentation.
