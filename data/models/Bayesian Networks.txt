This file discusses Bayesian Networks, explaining their probabilistic graphical model structure. Bayesian Networks represent a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each node in the graph corresponds to a random variable, and the edges represent the conditional dependencies between these variables.

Bayesian Networks are widely used in various fields, including:

1. **Medical Diagnosis**: They help in reasoning under uncertainty, allowing for the integration of various symptoms and test results to diagnose diseases.
2. **Risk Management**: In finance and insurance, Bayesian Networks can model risks and their interdependencies.
3. **Machine Learning**: They serve as a foundation for various algorithms, enabling probabilistic inference and decision-making.

The key components of a Bayesian Network include:

- **Nodes**: Represent random variables.
- **Edges**: Indicate the relationships between the variables.
- **Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs)**: Quantify the relationships by specifying the probability of each variable given its parents in the graph.

Bayesian Networks facilitate reasoning about uncertainty and are particularly useful for making predictions and understanding complex systems.
