This file discusses Principal Component Analysis (PCA), detailing its dimensionality reduction approach. PCA is a statistical technique used to simplify complex datasets by transforming them into a new set of variables, called principal components. These components are orthogonal and capture the maximum variance in the data, allowing for effective data visualization and noise reduction. PCA is widely used in exploratory data analysis, feature extraction, and preprocessing for machine learning algorithms. Its applications span various fields, including finance, biology, and image processing, making it a fundamental tool in data science.
