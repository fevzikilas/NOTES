Elastic Net Regression is a regularization technique that combines the properties of both Ridge and Lasso regression. It is particularly useful when dealing with datasets that have highly correlated features.

### Definition
Elastic Net Regression aims to improve the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces. It does this by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which is a linear combination of the L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties.

### Mathematical Formulation
The Elastic Net loss function can be expressed as:

Loss = ||y - Xβ||² + λ₁||β||₁ + λ₂||β||²

Where:
- y is the response variable.
- X is the matrix of features.
- β represents the coefficients.
- λ₁ and λ₂ are the regularization parameters for Lasso and Ridge penalties, respectively.

### Use Cases
Elastic Net is particularly effective in scenarios where:
- There are multiple features that are correlated with each other.
- The number of predictors (features) is much larger than the number of observations.
- A balance between feature selection (Lasso) and regularization (Ridge) is desired.

This technique is widely used in various fields, including finance, bioinformatics, and social sciences, where model interpretability and prediction accuracy are crucial.
