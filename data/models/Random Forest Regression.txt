Random Forest Regression is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting. It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputting the mean prediction of the individual trees for regression tasks.

Key Features:
- **Ensemble Method**: Utilizes the power of multiple decision trees to enhance performance.
- **Robustness**: Less prone to overfitting compared to a single decision tree.
- **Feature Importance**: Provides insights into the importance of different features in the dataset.

Use Cases:
- Suitable for complex datasets with non-linear relationships.
- Commonly used in various fields such as finance, healthcare, and marketing for predicting continuous outcomes.
