This file outlines Differential Evolution, explaining its optimization methodology. 

Differential Evolution (DE) is a population-based optimization algorithm used for solving complex optimization problems. It is particularly effective for continuous optimization tasks and is known for its simplicity and efficiency.

### Key Concepts:
- **Population**: DE maintains a population of candidate solutions, which evolve over generations.
- **Mutation**: New candidate solutions are generated by combining existing solutions, introducing diversity.
- **Crossover**: The algorithm combines mutated solutions with existing ones to create new candidates.
- **Selection**: The best candidates are selected for the next generation based on their fitness.

### Applications:
Differential Evolution is widely used in various fields, including engineering design, machine learning hyperparameter tuning, and financial modeling. Its ability to handle non-linear and multi-modal functions makes it a valuable tool for optimization tasks.
