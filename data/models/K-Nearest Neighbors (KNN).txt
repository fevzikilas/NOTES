K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, yet powerful algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It operates on the principle of finding the 'k' closest data points in the feature space to make predictions about a new data point.

### Algorithm Overview:
1. **Distance Metric**: KNN uses distance metrics such as Euclidean, Manhattan, or Minkowski to determine the proximity of data points.
2. **Choosing 'k'**: The value of 'k' is crucial; a small 'k' can lead to noise sensitivity, while a large 'k' may smooth out the decision boundary.
3. **Voting Mechanism**: For classification, KNN assigns the class label based on the majority vote of the 'k' nearest neighbors. For regression, it averages the values of the nearest neighbors.

### Use Cases:
- **Classification**: KNN is widely used in image recognition, recommendation systems, and pattern recognition.
- **Regression**: It can also predict continuous values, such as prices or temperatures, based on the average of the nearest neighbors.

### Advantages:
- Simple to understand and implement.
- No assumptions about data distribution.
- Naturally handles multi-class cases.

### Limitations:
- Computationally expensive for large datasets, as it requires distance calculations for all training samples.
- Sensitive to irrelevant features and the scale of the data.

KNN is a versatile algorithm that can be applied in various domains, making it a popular choice for many machine learning tasks.
