This file discusses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), explaining their efficiency in sequential data processing. GRUs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to capture dependencies in sequential data while addressing the vanishing gradient problem. They utilize gating mechanisms to control the flow of information, allowing them to maintain relevant information over longer sequences. GRUs are particularly effective in tasks such as natural language processing, time series prediction, and speech recognition, where understanding context and sequence is crucial. Their simpler structure compared to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks makes them computationally efficient while still achieving competitive performance in various applications.
