This file discusses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), detailing their architecture and applications in image processing. CNNs are a class of deep neural networks that are particularly effective for analyzing visual data. They utilize convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, making them suitable for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. CNNs typically consist of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, which work together to extract and learn features from input images. Their ability to capture spatial relationships and patterns has made them a cornerstone in the field of computer vision.
