This file outlines Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), detailing their use in modeling sequential data. HMMs are statistical models that assume the system being modeled is a Markov process with unobserved (hidden) states. They are widely used in various applications, including speech recognition, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.

Key components of HMMs include:

1. **States**: The hidden states of the model that are not directly observable.
2. **Observations**: The visible outputs that are generated by the hidden states.
3. **Transition Probabilities**: The probabilities of transitioning from one hidden state to another.
4. **Emission Probabilities**: The probabilities of observing a particular output from a hidden state.
5. **Initial State Probabilities**: The probabilities of starting in each hidden state.

HMMs are particularly useful for tasks where the sequence of observations is important, and they can be trained using algorithms such as the Baum-Welch algorithm.
