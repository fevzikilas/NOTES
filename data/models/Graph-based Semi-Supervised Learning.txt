This file discusses graph-based methods for semi-supervised learning. Graph-based semi-supervised learning leverages the structure of data represented as graphs, where nodes represent instances and edges represent relationships between them. This approach is particularly effective when labeled data is scarce, as it can utilize the information from both labeled and unlabeled data to improve learning performance.

Key concepts include:

1. **Graph Construction**: Creating a graph from the dataset, where edges can be based on similarity measures or domain knowledge.
2. **Label Propagation**: A technique where labels from labeled nodes are spread to unlabeled nodes through the graph structure, allowing for the incorporation of unlabeled data in the learning process.
3. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: A class of neural networks designed to operate on graph data, enabling the model to learn representations that capture the relationships between nodes effectively.
4. **Applications**: Commonly used in scenarios such as social network analysis, image classification, and natural language processing, where relationships between data points can provide valuable context.

Overall, graph-based semi-supervised learning is a powerful approach that enhances model performance by effectively utilizing the underlying structure of data.
