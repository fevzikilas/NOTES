This file discusses Case-Based Reasoning, explaining its methodology in problem-solving. Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is an approach to problem-solving that uses past experiences (cases) to understand and solve new problems. It involves the following key steps:

1. **Retrieve**: Identify and retrieve relevant cases from the case library that are similar to the current problem.
2. **Reuse**: Adapt the solutions from the retrieved cases to fit the new problem context.
3. **Revise**: Test the proposed solution and revise it if necessary based on feedback or new information.
4. **Retain**: Store the new case and its solution in the case library for future reference.

CBR is widely used in various fields, including medical diagnosis, customer support, and legal reasoning, due to its ability to leverage historical data and improve over time.
