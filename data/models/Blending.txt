This file describes Blending, explaining its method of combining predictions from different models. Blending is an ensemble learning technique that involves training multiple models and then combining their predictions to improve overall performance. It typically involves a two-step process: first, base models are trained on the training dataset, and then a meta-model is trained on the predictions of these base models to make the final prediction. This approach can help capture different patterns in the data and reduce the risk of overfitting, leading to better generalization on unseen data.
