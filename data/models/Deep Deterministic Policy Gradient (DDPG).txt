This file discusses Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), explaining its application in continuous action spaces. DDPG is an actor-critic algorithm that combines the benefits of both policy gradient and value-based methods. It is particularly effective in environments with high-dimensional action spaces, such as robotics and control tasks. The algorithm utilizes a deterministic policy and employs experience replay to stabilize training. DDPG has shown success in various applications, including robotic manipulation and autonomous driving, making it a valuable tool in the field of reinforcement learning.
