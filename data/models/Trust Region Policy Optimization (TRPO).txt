This file describes Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), explaining its methodology in policy optimization. TRPO is a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes policies by ensuring that updates to the policy are within a specified trust region. This approach helps to maintain stability during training and prevents large, potentially harmful updates to the policy. TRPO uses a constrained optimization framework, where the objective is to maximize expected rewards while adhering to a constraint on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the old and new policies. This ensures that the new policy does not deviate too much from the previous policy, leading to more reliable learning. TRPO has been successfully applied in various reinforcement learning tasks, particularly in environments with continuous action spaces.
